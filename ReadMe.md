# PacMan
Week 4 PacMan Exercise 
<img src="PacMan1.png">

This was an exercise for the 4th week of the MIT xPro program.
The assignment was to update the given code so that Pacman hits the wall, turns around, and comes back.
We also implemented the setInterval function.

# How to Run

## Step 1:
To make future improvements, download the files in the repository and open in the IDE of your choosing. I recommend Visual Studio Code or XCode.

## Step 2: 
Open the pacman.js file in the IDE. This is where you can make any changes to the code to update PacMan's movements. Save any changes. 

## Step 3: 
Open the index.html file in a web browswer.
